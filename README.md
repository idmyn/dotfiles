# dotfiles
very much a work in progress - nothing terribly original here

## symlinks
_these will only work for you if your folder structure is the same as mine (which is almost certainly isn't)_
_**that said**, the symlink destination files should be pretty standard (for macOS at least..?)_

**Neovim:** ```ln -s ~/GitHub/Active/dotfiles/init.vim ~/.config/nvim/init.vim```
